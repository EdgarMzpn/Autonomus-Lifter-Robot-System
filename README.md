# Autonomous Lifter Robot System
This project presents the development of an implementation in the Puzzlebot, an educational mobile robot designed to close the gap between education and industrial robotics. The Puzzlebot employs a differential drive system for precise maneuverability, making it suitable for a range of applications. Equipped with a NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a LiDAR sensor, and additional hardware, the robot integrates advanced algorithms and sensor fusion techniques to achieve effective navigation and obstacle avoidance. The navigation system utilizes the Bug2 algorithm for path planning, while odometry and an Extended Kalman Filter enhance localization accuracy. The early Puzzlebot's capabilities were validated through simulation using Gazebo software, ensuring robust performance in dynamic settings. Thus, this project aims to provide a versatile platform for both educational and experimental purposes in robotics.
